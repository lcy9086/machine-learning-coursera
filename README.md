# machine-learning-coursera
These are the programming assignments(in ipython notebook) from 
Coursera's Machine Learning course "Machine Learning Foundations: A Case Study Approach" taught by University of Washington.
Course Includes Study of:
* Linear Regression (one variable and multiple variables)
* Logistic Regression
* Support Vector Machine
* Regularization
* Clustering(K-means Algorithm,K-NN Algorithm)
* Anomaly Detection
* Recommender System(Personalized Recommendation Based on Collaborative Filtering)
* Deep learning(Neural networks)

Completed the course on machine learning with implementation using graphlab create(an optimized ML
liberary for python) by university of washington for building the model of the following problems:
• 1. Predicting House Prices: Build a Linear Regression model by learning the weights from training dataset.
• 2. Sentiment Analysis on Amazon product reviews: Build a logistic regression model to predict classification of review as
positive or negative.
• 3. Retrieving Similar Wikipedia Articles: Build a model using k-nearest neighbors search and k-means clustering algorithm
to find the similar articles.
• 4. Song Recommendation System: Build a model using co-occurrence matrices for collaborative filtering to make
personalized song recommendations.
• 5. Deep Learning for Similar Images: Build a model using deep features to get similar images of animals.For ex- similar
images of cat correspond to particular cat image.
